============
FinFisher, also known as FinSpy, is surveillance software marketed by Gamma International. [0]
It has been reported to be used by repressive regimes, such as Bahrain.

In august 2014, 40GB of this government malware have been leaked by hackers. [1]
The data is still being analyzed by hackers and human rights defenders such as the Internet Protection Lab.
The latter has namely started to analyze the "Bahrain Logs" [2].
As they state: "The log files contain 2489 unique IP addresses that the FinSpy master server tries to map to a geographical location when it initializes. We assume these IP addresses have been previously recorded by the system when infected machines ‘phoned home’ to the FinSpy master server."
The map just shows the concerned IP address locations.
